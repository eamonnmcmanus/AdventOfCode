These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
They are all coded in Java, needing Java 21 and `--enable-preview` (for string templates).

* [Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17) (least-cost path with constraints on moves)

  I gave up before finding the right Dynamic Programming approach. I ended up
  copying my approach from
  [David Brownman](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id/writeups/2023/day/17/).

* [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20) (pulse propagation)

  I had a strong suspicion of what the right approach might be for Part 2 but
  would have needed to investigate in detail to confirm. Instead I looked online
  and found
  [this description](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code/blob/master/src/AoC_2023/Dazbo%27s_Advent_of_Code_2023.ipynb#scrollTo=EFS4IeuPndFb)
  by Dazbo, which confirmed my suspicion. Then solving was straightforward.

* [Day 21](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21) (counting paths in an infinite graph)

  I was not really motivated to put in the work for Part 2 so I outright cheated, by copying
  [this solution](https://github.com/ash42/adventofcode/tree/main/adventofcode2023/src/nl/michielgraat/adventofcode2023/day21)
  by Michiel Graat.

* [Day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21) (intersections of 3-dimensional lines)

  This curious puzzle was entirely solvable with algebra, the computer only
  serving to solve simultaneous equations. I did the first part myself, but did
  not find the right approach for the second part on my own. The excellent
  [explanation and solution](https://github.com/dirk527/aoc2021/blob/main/src/aoc2023/Day24.java)
  by [@dirk527](https://github.com/dirk527) showed me the right path, but then
  there wasn't much for me to write.
