These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

All solutions are entirely the work of [Ã‰amonn McManus](https://github.com/eamonnmcmanus) except as noted below.

<dl>
<dt>[Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17) (least-cost path with constraints on moves)</dt>
<dd>I gave up before finding the right Dynamic Programming approach.
I ended up copying my approach from [David Brownman](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id/writeups/2023/day/17/).</dd>

<dt>[Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20) (pulse propagation)</dt>
<dd>I had a strong suspicion of what the right approach might be for Part 2 but would have needed to investigate in detail
to confirm. Instead I looked online and found [this description](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code/blob/master/src/AoC_2023/Dazbo%27s_Advent_of_Code_2023.ipynb#scrollTo=EFS4IeuPndFb)
by Dazbo, which confirmed my suspicion. Then solving was straightforward.</dd>

<dt>[Day 21](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21) (counting paths in an infinite graph)</dt>
<dd>I was not really motivated to put in the work for Part 2 so I outright cheated, by copying
[this solution](https://github.com/ash42/adventofcode/tree/main/adventofcode2023/src/nl/michielgraat/adventofcode2023/day21)
by Michiel Graat.</dd>

<dt>[Day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21) (intersections of 3-dimensional lines)</dt>
<dd>This curious puzzle was entirely solvable with algebra, the computer only serving to solve simultaneous equations.
I did the first part on my own, but did not find the right approach for the second part on my own.
The excellent [explanation and solution](https://github.com/dirk527/aoc2021/blob/main/src/aoc2023/Day24.java)
by @dirk527 showed me the right path, but then there wasn't much for me to write.</dd>
